Git for Windows 2.36.0
https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.36.0.windows.1

Changes since Git for Windows v2.35.3 (April 15th 2022)
This version includes Git LFS v3.1.4, addressing CVE-2022-24826 (if you use Git LFS with MinGit, you will want to upgrade).


Upcoming breaking changes

We plan to update the included bash to version 5.1 (currently 4.4) soon after Git for Windows 2.36.0 is released. Please check your shell scripts for potential compatibility issues.

Git for Windows will also stop supporting Windows Vista soon after Git for Windows 2.36.0 is released. Around the beginning of 2023, Git for Windows will drop support for Windows 7 and for Windows 8, following Cygwin's and MSYS2's lead (Git for Windows relies on MSYS2 for components such as Bash and Perl).
