https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/602646/content-of-etc-network-in-alpine-linux-image

Folders:
/etc/network/if-down.d/
/etc/network/if-post-down.d/
/etc/network/if-post-up.d/
/etc/network/if-pre-down.d/
/etc/network/if-pre-up.d/
/etc/network/if-up.d/

Those folders are hooks for ifupdown, there are a lot ifupdown implementation,
but alpine default one is busybox's, you can check the source here networking/ifupdown.c.

busybox only handle auto interface, support these builtin types.
